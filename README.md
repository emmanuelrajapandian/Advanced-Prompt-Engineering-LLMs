# Advanced-Prompt-Engineering-LLMs
Diving into Prompt Engineering for LLMs within this repository. Learning and practicing the latest techniques and methods through practical examples to gain working knowledge in this ever-growing technology.

Mixtral8x7B-Instruct LLM model is used explore the advanced prompting techniques. This LLM is capable enough to run on google colab thanks to [Denis Mazur](https://github.com/dvmazur) and [Artyom Eliseev](https://github.com/lavawolfiee) who have made this possible by quantizing the original model in mixed precision and implementing a MoE-specific offloading strategy.
